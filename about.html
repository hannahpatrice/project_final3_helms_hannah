		<h1>The Big Shots</h1>

			<h2>A passion business a lifetime in the making.</h2>

		<p>Like many dreams, the story of Big Shot Stable starts in childhood. With the urging of their grandparents Jean and John, Gigi and Johnny started riding at the Detroit Fairgrounds (of Seabiscuit fame) at the ages of 5 and 6.  After moving to Connecticut, they continued in equestrian events into their teen years and hung around at Sue Sharra’s barn, practicing for competition in weekend horse shows. Their interests also spread to the race track. The early '70s was the beginning of a magical decade in thoroughbred racing and these two kids at the “branding age” became fans for life. Key To The Mint, Ruffian, Saratoga, Penny Tweedy, Affirmed and Alydar and Belmont, Seattle Slew, Lucien Lauren, Ron Turcotte. These were all larger-than-life heroes for Gigi and Johnny. One August day, Johnny bet on a horse named Tom Swift who then set the Saratoga track record at 35:1 odds, paying enough for one more night at the Rip Van Winkle Inn in Saratoga Springs. Yet no hero was bigger than Riva Ridge was for 11-year-old Gigi. Riva Ridge won the '72 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, and “saved the farm” at Meadow Stables.  He became the star in every one of Gigi’s 5th grade projects and presentations, and the subject of all of her drawings.  Gigi’s dreams were forged by Riva Ridge, the son of First Landing and Iberia, who would have won the Triple Crown but for a muddy track on the third Saturday in May.
		</p>
		<p>Now fast forward about 30 years to when Gigi’s husband Stu suggested that they save for retirement.  Gigi had completed college, medical school, residency, and time in the Air Force. Their kids were growing and becoming less dependent.  She had begun to rekindle some of those dreams, those thoughts of Riva Ridge. Retirement? “I’m going to own a racehorse,” she whinnied.  She quickly set off on some research, and in 2005 Gigi and Johnny rescued a 5 year-old mare named Quincy Light off the Canter horse rescue list. This was a young thoroughbred race mare who needed a better home. And it was no coincidence that she is a great-granddaughter of Riva Ridge. Meanwhile, Johnny had researched the fledgling thoroughbred horse breeding and ownership program in Pennsylvania, which would prove to make racehorse ownership possible for individuals and small stables.  He also knew that standing at stud at Xanthus Farm in Gettysburg was Lil’s Lad, the colt who had been Johnny’s choice on the 1998 Derby trail before getting injured. Gigi and Johnny bred Quincy to Lil’s Lad, and then quickly bought another mare, Dena’s Darling, who was in foal to Lil’s Lad as well. Dena was not only related to Riva Ridge, she also had bloodlines to Key to the Mint, who had been Johnny’s favorite in the Derby class of 1972.
